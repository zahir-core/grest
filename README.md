# gREST

> An instant, full-featured, and scalable REST APIs framework with go. Designed to make rapid development easy with clean code and best performance.
> 
> It takes care of a lot of the complexities of developing REST APIs so you can focus on the business logic of your app. Build prototypes in minutes and production-ready apps in days. **Seriously**.
> 
> gREST gives you the structure to build service oriented apps from day one. When you eventually need to split your app into microservices it’s an easy transition.

## Inspired By

Originally, gREST inspired by the following frameworks, however we did it with a different approach, complementing its features, making it easier to use and more flexible with optimal performance and of course with [Go](https://go.dev) ways.

- [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com) — A framework for real-time applications and REST APIs.
- [LoopBack](https://loopback.io) — A highly extensible Node.js and TypeScript framework for building APIs and microservices.
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) — The PHP Framework for Web Artisans.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) — A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

## Library

gREST is REST APIs framework with a "batteries-included" philosophy, it means that gREST comes with most of the libraries and tools required for common use cases, out of the box, so you can focus on the business logic of your application instead of choosing libraries and tools or creating your own. To help realize that philosophy gREST use the following libraries and tools:

- [Fiber](https://gofiber.io) — An Express-inspired web framework written in Go.
- [GORM](https://gorm.io) — The fantastic ORM library for Golang.
- [go-redis](https://redis.uptrace.dev) — Redis client for Golang.
- [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) — Blazing fast, structured, leveled logging in Go.
- [GJSON](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson) — Go package that provides a fast and simple way to get values from a json document.
- [SJSON](https://github.com/tidwall/sjson) — Go package that provides a very fast and simple way to set a value in a json document.
- [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) — Visualize OpenAPI Specification definition in an interactive UI.
- [Package validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator) — Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual fields based on tags.
- [MinIO Go Client SDK](https://github.com/minio/minio-go) — MinIO Go Client SDK for Amazon S3 Compatible Cloud Storage
- etc
