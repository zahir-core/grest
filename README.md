# GREST

> An instant, full-featured, and scalable REST APIs framework with go. Designed to make rapid development easy with clean code and best performance.
> 
> It takes care of a lot of the complexities of developing REST APIs so you can focus on the business logic of your app. Build prototypes in minutes and production-ready apps in days. **Seriously**.
> 
> GREST gives you the structure to build service oriented apps from day one. When you eventually need to split your app into microservices it’s an easy transition.

## Getting Started

_Coming Soon..._

## Inspired By

Originally, GREST inspired by the following frameworks, however we did it with a different approach, complementing its features, making it easier to use and more flexible with optimal performance and of course with [Go](https://go.dev) ways.

- [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com) — A framework for real-time applications and REST APIs.
- [LoopBack](https://loopback.io) — A highly extensible Node.js and TypeScript framework for building APIs and microservices.
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) — The PHP Framework for Web Artisans.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) — A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

## Library

GREST is REST APIs framework with a "batteries-included" philosophy, it means that GREST comes with most of the libraries and tools required for common use cases, out of the box, so you can focus on the business logic of your application instead of choosing libraries and tools or creating your own. Thanks to the following libraries and tools that help GREST realize that philosophy :

- [Fiber](https://gofiber.io) — An Express-inspired web framework written in Go.
- [GORM](https://gorm.io) — The fantastic ORM library for Golang.
- [go-redis](https://redis.uptrace.dev) — Redis client for Golang.
- [Package validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator) — Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual fields based on tags.
- [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) — Zero Allocation JSON Logger.
- [@stoplight/elements](https://stoplight.io/open-source/elements) — Beautiful API documentation powered by OpenAPI and Markdown.
- [MinIO Go Client SDK](https://github.com/minio/minio-go) — MinIO Go Client SDK for Amazon S3 Compatible Cloud Storage
- etc
